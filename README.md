# Machine-Learning Projects

## 1. Tumor Classifier 
The purpose of this project is to implement logistic regression on a two-class problem and to
provide a report describing the results, experimental setup and comparison between the results
obtained from different setting of the algorithm and dataset. The Task is to classify suspected
FNA cells to Benign (class 0) or Malignant (class 1) using logistic regression as the classifier.
The features used for classification are pre-computed from images of a fine needle aspirate
(FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset used was Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer.

## 2. Clothing Image Classifier
The purpose of this project is to implement neural network and convolutional neural network
for the task of classification. The classification task will be that of recognizing an image and
identify it as one of ten classes. Model is trained using the Fashion-MNIST clothing images.
Following are the three tasks performed:
	• Built a Neural Network with one hidden layer trained and tested on Fashion-MNIST
	dataset.
	• Built a multi-layer Neural Network with open-source neural-network library, Keras
	on Fashion-MNIST dataset.
	• Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with open-source neural-network
library, Keras on Fashion-MNIST dataset.
The results obtained by each of the classifier (Single layer Neural Network, Multi-Layer neural
network and CNN) were evaluated and compared against each of the three models
